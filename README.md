# TurkanaNDVIChange
These notebooks show code that I wrote in the Python geemap package to ineract with Google Earth Engine's API. The purpose of the project was to detect change in NDVI in Turkana County, Kenya between 1989 and 2020. I identied an area of interest; obtained satellite imagery from various Landsat collection to create a mean composite image of spring imagery for each year; created NDVI rasters from those images; performed an unsupervised classification to divide area of interest into classes by NDVI; and created raster datasets illustrating change over specified time periods. This workflow is explained in detail in [this ESRI StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cd9ca599f09f455faa976545a9a18df2).
